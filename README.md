### Hi, I am Surya Pradeep - @SuryaPradeepM <img target="_blank" src="https://i.imgur.com/zj8ZWgr.png" height = "30.7"/>

I’m a Computer Science & Engineering graduate of 2020 batch. I’m an aspiring data scientist with experience in Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
I am deeply passionate about Data Science and have been in awe of how good Machines can “Learn”; how 100 lines of code can empower industries to automate tasks that otherwise take long, tedious hours to complete.
I continuously adapt to specific problems and situations to help those Artificial brains boost their learning.
I am a firm believer in Lifelong Learning and am a complete MOOC fanatic.

### How do I help machines "learn"? <img target="_blank" src="https://i.imgur.com/tTJgCkz.png" height = "30.7"/>
