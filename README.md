### Hi, I am Surya Pradeep - @SuryaPradeepM <img target="_blank" src="https://i.imgur.com/zj8ZWgr.png" height = "27"/>


I’m a Computer Science & Engineering graduate of 2020 batch. I'm an aspriring data scientist with experience in  Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.



I am deeply passionate about Data Science and have been in awe of how good Machines can "Learn"; how  100 lines of code can empower industries to automate tasks that otherwise take long, tedious hours to complete.<br> I continuously adapt to the specific problem and situation to help those Artificial brains boost their learning.<br>
I am a firm believer in Lifelong Learning and am a complete MOOC fanatic.


 How do I help machines "learn"? <img target="_blank" src="https://i.imgur.com/tTJgCkz.png" height = "27"/>

<img target="_blank" src="https://i.imgur.com/UqXfMdN.png" width = "17"/> Working with Machine Learning Algorithms (Linear, Logistic, Ridge, Lasso, KMeans, Random Forests, XGBoost, Neural Networks,... ).<br>
<img target="_blank" src="https://i.imgur.com/UqXfMdN.png" width = "17"/> Working on data gathering pipelines.<br>
<img target="_blank" src="https://i.imgur.com/UqXfMdN.png" width = "17"/> Working with technologies like Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Torch.<br>
<img target="_blank" src="https://i.imgur.com/UqXfMdN.png" width = "17"/> Building mathematical models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.<br>
<img target="_blank" src="https://i.imgur.com/UqXfMdN.png" width = "17"/> Reading and extracting insights from recent research papers.<br>
<img target="_blank" src="https://i.imgur.com/UqXfMdN.png" width = "17"/> Writing clean & understandable code.<br>
<img target="_blank" src="https://i.imgur.com/UqXfMdN.png" width = "17"/> Designing informative & beautiful visualizations from the data.<br>


### Things I'm good at:
**Languages:**  Python, R

**Libraries & Tools:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, Matplotlib, Keras, NLTK

**Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing,  Data Wrangling, Imaage Processing, Ensemble Methods, Statistical Analysis, Model Development & Evaluation Metrics.

Looking for a driven person who can serve as a DATA SCIENTIST, AI/ML ENGINEER with almost annoying attention to detail and a voracious appetite to learn new things and grow? You've got me!
